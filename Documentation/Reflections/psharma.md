## Sprint 1
In sprint 1, we just got the project set up and added some basic features.
### Work Done
I added the player scene and got basic movement set up. 
I also experimented with multiplayer and got hack club set up on my personal account
### Difficulties
Working with device ids is painful since on c-sharp the ids cant just be put into the inputs. Ben showed me how to do it.
### Surprises
How painful it is to work on a controller only game without controllers
### Lessons
I need to start grinding over the weekends
