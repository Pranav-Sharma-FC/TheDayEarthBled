## Sprint 1 (Pranav)
In sprint 1, we just got the project set up and added some basic features.
### Work Done
I added the player scene and got basic movement set up.
### Difficulties
Making sure the .gitignore caught everything was a pain since we're using new tools this year.
### Surprises
### Lessons

## Sprint 1 (Averi)
For the first two weeks, we worked on setting up the basic foundations for the game, so that next week, we'll be able to build on top of that.
### Work Done
I created the viewport, and I started creating the assets for the viewport to replace the placeholders I originally made it with.
### Difficulties
Coordinatiing everything in github and just getting started with these slightly newer aspects was a bit difficult.
###Lessons 
I've learned to do my research about whatever it is we're doing; apparently knowing more about what you're supposed to do makes the work itself abundantly easier. 
###Surprises
A surprise was how many smaller elements there are when it comes to making a game, and also how much time and effort all those smaller elemets really need.
